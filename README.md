# Film Industry Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is part of the CUBIX Data Challenge course.
- https://cubixedu.com/kepzes/data-challenge-2025
This project aims to analyze key factors that contribute to the success of films using real-world IMDB data and web scraping techniques. By leveraging statistical methods and visualization tools, we seek to uncover patterns in the film industry that can help predict box office success.

## Tools & Technologies

* Python: Data processing and analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

* SQL: Querying and structuring data in Azure SQL Database

* Web Scraping: Collecting additional data from online sources

* JASP: A free and open-source statistical software used for hypothesis testing and conducting various 
  statistical analyses on the dataset.

* Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation

* Machine Learning: Predictive modeling and hypothesis testing



## Data Sources

* IMDB dataset: Contains movie metadata, financial performance, and user ratings

* Web scraping: Supplementary data collection from movie-related websites

## Data Processing Steps

1. Data Collection: Extracted structured and unstructured data from various sources.

2. Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed inconsistencies, and standardized formats.

3. Feature Engineering: Created new variables to improve analysis (e.g., genre classification, director 
   impact, etc.).

4. Data Transformation: Converted numerical values (e.g., production costs, revenue) into meaningful     scales.

5. Database Storage: Structured and stored cleaned data in an Azure SQL Database for efficient querying.

## Analysis & Hypotheses

* H1: Films with higher production costs tend to receive higher average ratings.

* H2: The top 3 lead actors significantly influence box office revenue.

* H3: A strong correlation exists between the director's past success and a film’s profitability.

* H4: Specific genres have a higher probability of commercial success.

* H5: Movies with shorter runtimes are more likely to perform well in streaming services.

## Results & Visualizations

* Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visualizations showcasing trends, correlations, and key performance     indicators.

* Statistical Insights: Hypothesis testing results with supporting data analysis.

* AI-Generated Movie Poster: A visual representation of an ideal blockbuster based on data-driven insights.
