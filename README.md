Film Industry Data Analysis Project

Overview

This project aims to analyze key factors that contribute to the success of films using real-world IMDB data and web scraping techniques. By leveraging statistical methods and visualization tools, we seek to uncover patterns in the film industry that can help predict box office success.

Tools & Technologies

Python: Data processing and analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL: Querying and structuring data in Azure SQL Database

Web Scraping: Collecting additional data from online sources

JASP: A free and open-source statistical software used for hypothesis testing and conducting various statistical analyses on the dataset.

Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation

Machine Learning: Predictive modeling and hypothesis testing

AI-Generated Graphics: Creating movie posters

Data Sources

IMDB dataset: Contains movie metadata, financial performance, and user ratings

Web scraping: Supplementary data collection from movie-related websites

Data Processing Steps

Data Collection: Extracted structured and unstructured data from various sources.

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed inconsistencies, and standardized formats.

Feature Engineering: Created new variables to improve analysis (e.g., genre classification, director impact, etc.).

Data Transformation: Converted numerical values (e.g., production costs, revenue) into meaningful scales.

Database Storage: Structured and stored cleaned data in an Azure SQL Database for efficient querying.

Analysis & Hypotheses

H1: Films with higher production costs tend to receive higher average ratings.

H2: The top 3 lead actors significantly influence box office revenue.

H3: A strong correlation exists between the director's past success and a film’s profitability.

H4: Specific genres have a higher probability of commercial success.

H5: Movies with shorter runtimes are more likely to perform well in streaming services.

Results & Visualizations

Power BI Dashboard: Interactive visualizations showcasing trends, correlations, and key performance indicators.

Statistical Insights: Hypothesis testing results with supporting data analysis.

AI-Generated Movie Poster: A visual representation of an ideal blockbuster based on data-driven insights.
